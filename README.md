User Dashboard in React.js

Project Overview

User Form Module:
The User Form module facilitates the seamless submission of user data to Firebase. It includes input fields for Username, Phone, Email, and Profile Picture. Upon submission, the data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database. The form implements basic validation, ensuring accurate and complete user information.

User Table Module:
The User Table module displays real-time user data from Firebase. The table includes columns for Username, Phone, Email, Profile Picture, and additional information. The displayed information reflects the submitted data from the User Form module.

Technology Stack

Frontend Development:
The frontend is developed using React.js with Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

Backend Development:
Firebase is utilized for backend services, specifically the Realtime Database. The backend handles the storage of user data submitted through the User Form module.

Profile Picture Handling:
Currently, there is an issue with reading and updating profile pictures. Further investigation is ongoing to resolve this matter.

Experience:
While I handled the frontend development independently, ChatGPT was utilized for backend assistance. Code snippets and conceptual guidance from ChatGPT, coupled with Firebase documentation, contributed to the completion of the task.
